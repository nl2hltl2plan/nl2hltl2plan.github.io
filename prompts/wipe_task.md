Please help me to compose a skill to wipe a surface. A dry eraser is attached to the end effector of the robot arm. The wipe action can be considered as a movement towards a goal while maintaining a force from the eraser to the surface. The desired goal will be given in controller parameters. The surface lies on the table, therefore, the desired force to be applied on the surface is [0,0,0,0,0,-1].
